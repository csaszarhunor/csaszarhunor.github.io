                    Hi there.</p>
                <p>
                    My name is Császár Hunor Tamás and I am pleased to welcome you on my website.</p>
                <p>
                    My studies are about visual arts mainly, I finished in the architecture department
                    of the high school for art in my hometown, Csíkszereda. Then I went to study
                    graphic design and applied art in Partium Christian University, Nagyvárad. After
                    finishing I became a freelancer graphic designer.</p>
                <p>
                    Few month ago I heard about Codecool,
                    a newly organizing school network to teach coding and I became interested.
                    I learnt the basics of computer science and Python language and now I'm diving
                    into the world of the web by learning about HTML, CSS and JS.
